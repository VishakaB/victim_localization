# victim_localization
With the advent of 4G/5G  networks, smartphones are equipped with technologies such as GPS, MIMO, and D2D communications, which can be helpful during disasters, especially in out-of-coverage areas. The goal is to propose a system that can localize both in-coverage and out-of-coverage devices using a combination of GPS, reference signal strength indicators, angle of arrival, and time of arrival estimations. Such estimations are collected from emergency calls arriving at the core network via a D2D multi-hop protocols are considered. 
Taking into account the uncertainty of such data, a dynamic constraint satisfaction problem (DCSP) is formulated to localize victims in real-time.
Such localization is conducted, assuming that the absolute positions of the relay devices in the multi-hop transmission are not known. Next, in order to evaluate the performance. Three baseline multi-victim localization (MVLA) algorithms, MVLA_all, MVLA_recent, and MVLA_seq, are studied. Additionally, such algorithms are compared with an existing particle filtering-based localization algorithm called RSSI Montecarlo boxed localization (RSSI-MCL) concerning parameters such as localization error, 
computational delay under a varying number of emergency user devices, functioning gNBs, etc.
